## MediaMod Privacy Policy
This privacy policy applies to MediaMod (reffered to as 'the mod', 'mod'). We understand how important your privacy is and we only collect data that is absolutely necessary for analytics or for major parts of the mod to function.

### What data do we collect?
When you start your Minecraft Client the client automatically sends your UUID to our server, this is for analytical purposes and also for the 'MediaMod Parties' functionality. This UUID is not publicly accessible by anyone else, they will not be able to check if you use MediaMod.
When the client is closed your UUID is again sent to our server to mark your user as 'offline', again this is for analytical purposes and for the 'MediaMod Parties' functionality.
When you are the host of a MediaMod Party the current track identifier, timestamp and if the playback is paused or not is sent to our server when a new song is started or the media is unpaused.

We also collect your current track name and artist name, this is used for features like MediaMod Parties and Levelhead Integration

### Security
When your client first contacts our server, it recieves a secret which it will use for future requests, without this secret no other requests can be made including the 'offline' request. When the client is closed this secret is discarded and no-longer usable. All data apart from your UUID and username is removed when you close the client and repopulated when neccesary.

### Notes
By downloading MediaMod, you are agreeing to the collection of your UUID, username and the other data that is outlined above.
