## MediaMod Privacy Policy
This privacy policy applies to MediaMod (reffered to as 'the mod', 'mod'). We understand how important your privacy is and we only collect data that is absolutely necessary for analytics or for major parts of the mod to function.

### What data do we collect?
When you start your Minecraft Client the client automatically sends your UUID to our server, this is for analytical purposes and also for the 'MediaMod Parties' functionality. This UUID is not publicly accessible by anyone else, they will not be able to check if you use MediaMod.
When the client is closed your UUID is again sent to our server to mark your user as 'offline', again this is for analytical purposes and for the 'MediaMod Parties' functionality.
When you are the host of a MediaMod Party the current track identifier, timestamp and if the playback is paused or not is sent to our server when a new song is started or the media is unpaused.

### Security
When your client first contacts our server, it recieves a secret which it will use for future requests, without this secret no other requests can be made including the 'offline' request. When the client is closed this secret is discarded and no-longer usable

### Opting out
If you wish to opt out of this data collection, you can disable 'Snooper' in Minecraft's Options, this will prevent MediaMod Parties from functioning as it requires some data to be collected to function.
Please note that this will not delete your information from our database, if you wish for your user to be removed from the database please contact Conor at conorthedev@gmail.com with the subject 'MediaMod Data Removal Request: [your username]'
